## Hi there, I'm Altamash 

Welcome! I’m Altamash, a data scientist at 2nd Order Solutions :smile: 
I use cutting edge machine learning and analytics to deliver impactful
credit risk and lending solutions for leading financial institutions, banks, and fintechs.

Originally from Pakistan, I came to the US to pursue both my Bachelor’s and Master’s
degrees at Duke University. At Duke, I fell in love with statistical modeling and
machine learning when I saw firsthand their potential for bringing transformational
change in our world. Over the years, I have had many amazing opportunities to learn
and grow as a data scientist through projects in cybersecurity, fraud detection, infectious
disease research, and more.

For an in depth view into my work, check out my repositories.
I love to share ideas and connect with professionals in all fields so feel free to email me 
if you ever want to chat!
