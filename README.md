## Hi there, I'm Altamash <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

Welcome! I’m Altamash, a data scientist at Proofpoint Inc :smile: 
I use cutting edge machine learning and analytics to keep people safe on the internet

Originally from Pakistan, I came to the US to pursue both my Bachelor’s and Master’s
degrees at Duke University. At Duke, I fell in love with statistical modeling and
machine learning when I saw firsthand their potential for bringing transformational
change in our world. Over the years, I have had many amazing opportunities to learn
and grow as a data scientist through work in cybersecurity, credit risk, fraud detection, 
and more.

For an in depth view into my work, check out my repositories.
I love to share ideas and connect with professionals in all fields so feel free to email me 
if you ever want to chat!
